        <p>If I could, I would give you the stars that sparkle in the night sky,
            The sun that shines on a bright day,
            But I can only give you my love, I hope that’s enough.</p>

        <p>I love you so much that I’m going crazy. I can’t stop thinking and dreaming about you. Only it makes me feel alive and gives my life a meaning.
            Please, don’t ever take it away from me.</p>

        <p>I am feeling jealous of all the people that you ever hugged,
            Because for a moment they were holding the whole world of mine.
