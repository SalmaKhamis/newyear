        <p>If I could, I would give you the stars that sparkle in the night sky,
            The sun that shines on a bright day,
            But I can only give you my love, I hope that’s enough.</p>
        <img src="3m.jpeg" style="width:100%">
        <p>I love you so much that I’m going crazy. I can’t stop thinking and dreaming about you. Only it makes me feel alive and gives my life a meaning.
            Please, don’t ever take it aqway from me.</p>
        <img src="m16.jpeg" style="width:100%">
        <p>If somebody would ask me a question what a beautiful life means to me, I would put my arms around you, lean my head on your shoulder and say “Like this!”
        </p>
        <img src="m5.jpg" style="width:100%">
        <p>I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.</p>
        <img src="m1.jpg" style="width:100%">
        <p>Flatter me, and I may not believe you. Criticize me, and I may not like you. Ignore me, and I may not forgive you. Encourage me, and I will not forget you. Love me and I may be forced to love you. </p>

        <p>Meeting and knowing a person like you has made me happy in a million ways.
            And if you ever have to leave me, I will find a million reasons for you to stay.</p>
        <img src="m2.jpg" style="width:100%">
        <p>What is a flower without the sun, what is the earth without the sky?
            Who am I without you, that’s why I tell you that I love you.</p>
        <img src="m14.jpeg" style="width:100%">
        <p>I am feeling jealous of all the people that you ever hugged,
            Because for a moment they were holding the whole world of mine.
        </p>
        <img src="m14.jpeg" style="width:100%">
        <p>You make me happy in a thousand ways. I love you to the moon and back, and I have no idea what I would do, if I lost you, because I feel like I will lose my entire world.</p>
        <img src="m17.jpeg" style="width:100%">
        <p>I’m here. I love you. I don’t care if you need to stay up crying all night long, I will stay with you. There’s nothing you can ever do to lose my love. I will protect you until you die, and after your death I will still protect you. I am stronger than depression and I am braver than loneliness and nothing will ever exhaust me.
